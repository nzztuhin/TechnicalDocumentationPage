            <p>PHP is scripting language that is widely used for web development purposes. A scripting language is basically language that is translated into machine language when the code is run rather than beforehand. PHP is popular because of its flexibility, ease of use and learn and dynamic property. Though is PHP having all its upsides,coding in PHP gets repetitive. This repetitiveness with addition of new programmers inability of organizing code ultimately leads to code that is unreadable and not very usable.</p>
            <p>Here to solve these problems PHP frameworks come into play. PHP frameworks helps developers by providing them with templates that a developer can easily follow to write their code. Also, when other developers read or edit other programmer’s code the template helps them to naviagate throughout the code. These frameworks also come with API and extensions that further in line helps to build large projects with ease. In recent years many frameworks for PHP have been developed. Developers can choose among popular frameworks like Laravel, CakePHP, CodeIgniter etc. In this report we will be going through the differences among the major three frameworks of PHP that are Laravel, CodeIgniter and CakePHP.  </p>

            <p>Laravel is a PHP-based web platform with an MVC architecture
                at its heart. Laravel was designed to make it easier for PHP developers to get started. With Laravel, you spend less time worrying
                about a project’s configuration, design, and dependencies and more
                time getting down to business. Laravel is an MVC platform for
                developing modern web applications, as previously mentioned. It’s
                a software architecture standard that distinguishes between the
                representation of data and how users communicate with it. Its architectural standard, which dates back to the mid-1970s, is not
                particularly recent. It’s still important, and it’s used by a lot of
                frameworks today.</p>
                <code>?php namespace App;
                    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
                    class Task extends Model
                    }</code>
            <h3>Model</h3>
            <p>Model in MVC, as we all know, handles the data in the database or
                some other storage of the application. Model is a class of properties
                in the Laravel app. In other words, if you design a Student project
                in Laravel and build a class with a unique name, that class will be
                the model for your tables, and columns will be database properties.
                Student Properties
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li> Department</li>
                    <li> Enroll No</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>View and Control</h3>
            <p>In the MVC Pattern view is used to display data. If we discuss
                Views of Laravel then all the views are stored in the directory
                resources/views. For example, you create a student.blade.php file
                then it is stored in a resources/views directory of our project. That
                file contains code and View display the page</p>
                <code>// Using a short name
                    Cache::config('short', [
                        'className' => 'File',
                        'duration' => '+1 hours',
                        'path' => CACHE,
                        'prefix' => 'cake_short_'
                    ]);
                    </code>
            <p>In the MVC Pattern Controller is used to handling the request.
                With a single line of code, Laravel resource routing assigns the
                typical “CRUD” routes to a controller. It works as a directing traffic
                between Views and Models. Laravel will create a new file in the
                app/Http/Controllers directory called StudentController.php. The
                controller includes a method for each of the available resource
                operations. Resource Controller handles many actions like Get,
                Post, Delete, Put, Patch etc</p>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scalable</li>
                <li>Includes namespaces and interfaces</li>
                <li>Reuses the components</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes break application when you move Laravel 4 to 5</li>
                <li>Upgrades might be problematic</li>
                <li>Heavy documentation</li>

        <section id="CAKEPHP_ARCHITECTURE" class="main-section">
            <header>CAKEPHP ARCHITECTURE</header>
            <p>CakePHP is a PHP application that is free to use. Its aim is to make
                the process of creating, deploying, and maintaining applications
                much simpler. CakePHP uses an MVC-style architecture that is bothefficient and simple to understand. Models, Views, and Controllers
                ensure the business logic is kept separate from the data and presentation layers in a natural way. CakePHP ORM (object-relational
                mapping) is a PHP hybrid that borrows key concepts from both the
                active record and data mapper patterns. The CakePHP ORM has
                two primary object types: table and entity classes, which represent
                database tables and individual table rows, respectively. CakePHP 3
                included a query builder to go along with the new ORM. Instead of
                writing SQL queries by hand, the query builder offers a collection of
                classes and methods for creating them programmatically. The query
                builder is heavily used by the ORM. Routing and reverse routing
                are two different types of routing. Incoming requests are routed to
                the correct controller and action using the CakePHP router, which
                allows for complex HTTP application routing. Reverse routing esatablishes a connection between routes and links, ensuring that links
                are created with the correct uniform resource locator every time</p>
                <code>'Cache' => [
                    'short' => [
                        'className' => 'File',
                        'duration' => '+1 hours',
                        'path' => CACHE,
                        'prefix' => 'cake_short_'
                    ],
                    // Using a fully namespaced name.
                    'long' => [
                        'className' => 'Cake\Cache\Engine\FileEngine',
                        'duration' => '+1 week',
                        'probability' => 100,
                        'path' => CACHE . 'long' . DS,
                    ]
                ]</code>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CakePHP’s code generation and scaffolding function allows
                        programmers to build prototypes and reusable code quickly.
                        Developers become more efficient as a result of code reuse,
                        which reduces total development time. They can also quickly
                        build new PHP applications by repurposing existing code
                        for various projects.</li>
                    <li>CakePHP does not require programmers to use complex XML
                        or YAML files, unlike other PHP programming frameworks.
                        They can quickly set up the database and begin developing
                        the application. In addition, by automating the functions, the
                        architecture facilitates database management. To prevent
                        writing additional code, programmers may use CakePHP’s
                        built-in validation and authentication features</li>
                    <li>Working with standard PHP classes can be intimidating for
                        many developers. CakePHP helps programmers to access the
                        Core and App folders directly when working with various
                        groups. As a result, they would be able to describe the functions of each class in a much more straightforward mann </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many users believe CakePHP’s documentation is insufficient
                        and needs to be improved. CakePHP is known to be more
                        complex than other PHP frameworks such as CodeIgniter,
                        despite being quick and easy to understand. As a result,
                        developers must devote both time and effort to learning
                        CakePHP’s different features.</li>
                    <li>CakePHP does not allow default routes for Fancy URLs, unlike other PHP frameworks such as Symfony. As a result,
                        programmers must update the default routes when creating
                        Fancy URLs. CakePHP’s efficiency for modern web application creation is harmed by this functional</li>
                    <li>users have also mentioned the difficulties in upgrading CakePHP
                        from version 2.x to 3.x. CakePHP 3 does not accept a range
                        of backwards compatible improvements in order to make it
                        quicker. As a result, web programmers would find it difficult
                        to upgrade their current applications to the latest version of
                        the PHP platform. Developers, on the other hand, can use
                        CakePHP 3 to create applications with the latest features.</li>

        <section id="CODEIGNITER_ARCHITECTURE" class="main-section">
            <header>CODEIGNITER ARCHITECTURE</header>
            <p>CodeIgniter is a lightweight PHP platform designed for developers
                who need a simple and elegant toolkit to build full-featured web applications.CodeIgniter is loosely based on the popular model–view–controller
                (MVC) development pattern. Although controller classes are required for CodeIgniter creation, models and views are optional.
                CodeIgniter can also be updated to use Hierarchical Model View
                Controller (HMVC), which allows developers to organize Controller,
                Models, and Views in a sub-directory structure</p>
                <code><?php 
                    class Test extends CI_Controller {
                     
                       public function index() { 
                          $this->load->helper('url'); 
                          $this->load->view('test');  } 
                    } ?></code>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The source code for the CodeIgniter framework is around
                    2MB in size. This makes learning CodeIgniter and how it
                    works a breeze. It also makes it easier to deploy and update.</li>
                <li>Users prefer applications that are quick to load. If you’ve
                    worked with some of the more recent frameworks, you’ll
                    notice that they load in less than a second after installation.
                    You will load CodeIgniter in less than 50 milliseconds on
                    average. When you deal with the CodeIgniter platform, you
                    don’t have to spend as much time optimizing as you might
                    with another framework</li>
                <li>The built-in features are intended to work on their own,
                    without the need for additional components. This makes
                    maintenance and improvements a breeze.
                    </li>
                <li>The system is well known, and CodeIgniter has a lot of good
                    books, tutorials, and answers to forum questions. This means
                    that whatever dilemma you’re facing, chances are somebody
                    has already faced it, solved it, and the answer is waiting for
                    you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>CodeIgniter is a model-view-controller system. Model View Controller is the abbreviation for Model View Controller. This the first to react when a user requests a resource. The controller
                decodes the user’s request and, if necessary, requests the data.
                If you want to retrieve a customer with the id=3, for example, the
                controller will receive your request and then ask the CodeIgniter
                models to retrieve the record with the id=3. The record will be
                returned to the controller by the CodeIgniter models. After that,
                the controller sends the result to the view, which formats it for human use. The user is then presented with the results in the browser.
